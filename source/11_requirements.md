# Requirements

## ASD Classifier

- Classify ASD and typical controls based on functional connectivity using the rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I dataset and deep learning techniques. The classifier should be generalisable across heterogeneous phenotypes.



## Functional Connectivity related to ASD

- Use the trained classifier to interpret the regional functional connections which best differentiate ASD from controls and contributed most to the classification.
