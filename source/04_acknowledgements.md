# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who helped out -->

Thanks to my supervisor, Dr Haiping Lu, for his insights throughout the project, and suggesting that I slightly change the topic of my project to match my passion for Deep Learning. Thanks also to Shuo Zhou for his assistance with \LaTeX\ and suggestions regarding tuning Machine Learning models.

A number of software packages were invaluable to this project. In particular thanks to all of the contributors involved with nilearn [@nilearn], scikit-learn [@scikit-learn], pandoc, TensorFlow [@tensorflow2015-whitepaper] and Keras [@chollet2015keras]. It is a testament to the Open Source Software philosophy that the best tools across so many disciplines are released freely.

Thanks to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and the Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP) for making the dataset that I used for this project freely available [@neuro_preprocessing].

Also thanks to Tom Pollard *et al.* for the template which made writing this dissertation with pandoc and \LaTeX\ a lot easier [@phd_thesis_template].

Last but by no means least, thank you to all of my incredible friends and family, without whom, University would have been exponentially more difficult or impossible. In particular, thanks to my parents who have gone above and beyond to support me in all of my endeavours.
